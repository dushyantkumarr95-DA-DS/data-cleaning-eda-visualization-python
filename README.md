Problem Statement-
-> The dataset(uncleaned.csv) contains employee data of an organization, information about their employee_id, name, position, salary, age, gender, department, hire-date.
-> The analysis is performed to identify and clean inconsistencies in the dataset, and extract meaningful insights through visualization.

Steps Performed-
-> 1) Data understanding-
   -> Understanding structure of data(number of rows,columns).
   -> Understanding of numerical and categorical features.
   -> Detecting duplicated rows and missing values.

-> 2) Data Cleaning-
   -> Deleting duplicated rows.
   -> Handeling missing values using mean,median,mode.
   -> Treating outliers (unrealistic values) by replacing them with mean, median, mode.
   -> Data type conversion where required.

-> 3) Exploratory Data Analysis and data visualization -
   -> Corelation analysis to understand feature relationship using heatmap.
   -> Visual exploration of distributions and trends.
   -> Plots to support insights obtained from the data.
   -> Histogram for distribution analysis.

-> 4) Drawing insights-
   -> Finding maximum number of employees are in which department, to understand structure of organisation.
   -> Comparison of average salaries.
   -> Salary distributions, to understand majority of employees earming range.
   -> Comparision of average salary based on gender to find biasness.
   -> Relationship between tenure and salary.
   -> Understanding employee retention risk.
